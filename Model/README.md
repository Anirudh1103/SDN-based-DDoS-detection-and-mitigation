In this jupyter notebook file you can see that I have used different training models like KNN, GMM, RF etc.
I have used diffrent training models and using the provided dataset I have checked the accuracy that each model is providing.
Doing this is necassary as I need to choose one model to further proceed with the development of the project.
Through this notebook we can see that Random Forest provides us highest accuracy therefore I will be proceeding my development with Random Forest Model
